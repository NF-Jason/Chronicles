# Intro
As we know our world is a disc-shaped realm that sits upon the giant [[World Tree]], with massive stalactites that hang from the bottom of our world. The world is encased in the [[Crystalline Dome]], supported by the branches of the [[World Tree]], which contains the world's air and atmosphere. The outer edge is a frozen wasteland, where the corpse of the [[Elder Dragon of Water]]  still radiates immense cold. As one moves towards the middle, the climate becomes more temperate, until reaching the warm and dry central region surrounding the freshwater inner sea. Our sun was dragged by a chariot-riding God, who brings warmth and light to the different parts of the world.

The gods once directly influenced the world, but after their last war, [[The One]] above all banished them from interfering in worldly matters. They where striped out of there physical Forms, to never again directly influence the mortal realms.

The emergence of a new species, the [[Demigar]], and later their human descendants, began rapidly conquering the world in the name of the gods, with the goal of establishing a new order. They were subjugating the native populations of different regions around the inner sea. That conflict shaped the political, economic, and social structures of the world back then.

The [[World Tree]], with its green branches that sprout around the edge of the world, was also back then visible from almost anywhere in our world. It stretches far up into the [[Celestial Planes]] and deep into the [[Under-Spires]], with its roots stopping just above the maw of the [[Leviathan]]. The underworld is a physical place, consisting of gigantic spires beneath the world disc that hold many horrors of forgotten ages.

As an Imperial Scholar, my view centers around the [[Demigar]] and us, their human descendants, with a particular emphasis on the [[Great Central Peninsula]] , located in the [[Inner Sea]]. As our story progressed, our focus expanded outward in all directions to encompass a wide range of regions and cultures, ultimately reaching the very edge of the world.

I am fascinated by the rich history of our world and the complex interplay between the mortal and the divine. The emergence of the [[Demigar]] and their conquest of the world had significant implications for the balance of power among the gods, shaping the divine politics of the world. This was a story of struggle, conflict, and transformation, with a unique character and a rich history that reflects the complex interplay between the mortal and the divine.
