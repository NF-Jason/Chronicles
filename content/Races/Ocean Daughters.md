## The Scorched
### Identity & Origins
The Scorched emerged during the Time of Legends. They were the last of the Ocean Daughter ethnicities to form—descendants of Storm Daughter women who fled or were exiled for keeping their sons when others would have killed or given them away. These refugees wandered east and eventually settled in the region now known as the [[Scorched Lands]]. There, long after the gods had withdrawn from the mortal realm, they discovered **divine fire shards**—fragments left behind from the death of the [[Elder Dragon of Fire]] and the battles of the [[First God of War]].

These shards burned with tireless heat, seeped warmth into the stone, and created natural forges and glowing vents within the land. The exiles learned to shape tools, pottery, and metal using these shards. Over generations, living near this divine residue changed their people. Some children were born with an inner spark—the first **Fireborn**—whose magic flowed not from gods, but from the lingering power of the shards.

### Worldview
The Scorched believe fire is a covenant—representing defiance, renewal, and transformation. Their core beliefs include:
- Pain creates strength.
- Heat reveals truth.
- Ash remembers every shape it once held.

### Society
A semi-nomadic culture that moves as the land "cools" spiritually. Their communities contain:
- **Ashmothers** – women who bear sons.
- **Fireborn** – individuals gifted in elemental fire magic.
- **Kiln Fathers** – male spiritual guides and fire-tenders.
- **Emberline Families** – hereditary lines of fire-dancers and forge-mages.

### Magic & Rituals
The Scorched began with no innate fire magic. Their mastery came from learning to harness **the divine shards** buried beneath their lands—creating forges, tools, and ritual flames that no other Ocean Daughter tribe possessed.

Generations of living beside these forges awakened something new. Some children were born with fire in their blood, their bodies resonating with the heat of the shards. These were the first **Fireborn**, who can call upon the latent warmth of the land itself.

Their magic blends geomancy, shard-attunement, and ritual movement. Heat-haze is considered a language, and mirages are treated as wandering spirits of flame.

### Cultural Traits
- Fire and ash body paint.
- Volcanic-glass weaponry.
- Terracotta masks.
- Ash tattoos.
- Ember-resistant cloaks.
- Communal forging rites.

### Religion & Myth
After the gods withdrew from the mortal world, the newly risen **God of the Forge** became the patron of the Scorched. He did not father their people, but he recognized their talent and resolve. He taught them how to safely handle the divine shards and unlocked the deeper secrets of forging with living flame.

Their mythic ancestor, the **Ash Father**, is believed to be the first Scorched man whose birth coincided with a shard flare—a surge of divine heat in the land. He symbolizes rebellion, self-forging, and the courage to shape one’s own identity.

### Relationships with Cousins
- The Ocean Daughters consider them cursed or defiled.
- The Storm Daughters harbor quiet resentment.
- The Scorched refer to both groups as "the Water-Bound."
