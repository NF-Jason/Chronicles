Dear Journal, Today, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into the origins of the first god of war. It is said that in the beginning, when the world was still young, there was a great imbalance. The forces of chaos and destruction threatened to consume everything and all seemed lost. It was in this moment of despair that the [[Great Spirit of Death]] intervened. From the depths of the underworld, it called forth the essence of violence and molded it into a single being, the first god of war.

This lord of destruction was not a mere deity, but a weapon, crafted by the [[Great Spirit of Death]] and [[The Ona]] for the purpose of restoring balance to the world. He was primal and savage, a reflection of the forces he was meant to combat. Despite his brutal nature, the gods saw the potential in him and tasked him with defending the world from the forces of chaos.

 In his time, he was unmatched in battle. He fought with a ferocity that inspired fear in his enemies and respect in his allies. His weapon of choice was a club, forged from the fang of the [[Elder Dragon of Fire]], and he was feared by all who encountered him.

However, as time passed, the brutal nature that made him so effective in battle began to consume him. He became more savage, more animalistic.

In the time of peace that followed the law of the gods he was ever more the savage uncontrolled with no one to fight any longer, he fell to his baser desires and eventually, he forced himself upon his son's wife. This act, along with his increasing madness, led to his eventual downfall at the hands of his son, [[God of Murder|First God of the Forge]], who stole his father's weapon and used it to slay him.

It is said that after his death, he was cast into the underworld, where he remains to this day, a symbol of the power and destructive potential of the forces of war.

# Notes
- teamed up with the dwarven ancestors
- killed the [[Elder Dragon of Fire]] (used the tooth to kreate some super soldiers???), lost an eye.
- not on the battlefield he was restless and gave in to his baser instincts, he forced himself onto [[Demon Queen of Madness|Goddess of Art and Song]], the wife of his [[God of Murder|First God of the Forge]]. She throws herself off of the celestial plans, into the abyss (after giving berth to the [[Goddess of War and Strategy]] ). [[God of Murder|First God of the Forge]] was driven mad, stole his father's weapon, reforged it to become the mighty weapon ... Magmaaxt??? (The god-killer) ... and used it to kill his father. With this act, he succumbed to rage and murder and fell upon the world to wreak havoc onto the mortal races.
- After his death, his essence was bound into a bronze urn, deep in the [[Under-Spires]].
