Son of an [[Elder Dragon of Water]] and the [[First God of War]], is a deity who rules over the vast and mysterious oceans of the world. Often depicted as a muscular man with blue-green scales covering his body, webbed fingers, and toes, he wields a harpoon made of coral. His hair is made of seaweed, and his eyes are a deep ocean blue. He was also often depicted riding a giant seashell pulled by Sea Serpents.

As a powerful God’s domain encompasses the oceans and the sea life within. He has the ability to summon tidal waves, control sea creatures, and open portals to the underworld. These abilities make him one of the most fearsome and respected Gods in the pantheon.

Despite his impressive power, he is known for his brash and impulsive personality. He can be quick to anger but is fiercely protective of the oceans and its creatures. He values courage and strength in battle, but also has a deep respect for the power of the ocean and the forces of its nature.

He is widely worshipped by sailors and fisherfolk, who often pray to him for safe voyages and bountiful catches. Coastal communities also offer him tribute in the form of precious stones or artwork depicting sea creatures. His power and influence are felt throughout the world, as his realm encompasses most of the planet's surface.

In myth and legend, he is often associated with adventure and peril. Sailors and adventurers tell tales of his wrath and his mercy, of his ability to protect those who respect him and punish those who dare to cross him. He is a powerful and enigmatic God, one who commands respect and fear in equal measure.

## Artifacts
So, the **Harpoon of the Sea** represents the violent and destructive side of the ocean god's power, while the **Crown of Ocean** represents the more benevolent and nurturing side. Both artifacts carry great power and risk, and those who wield them must be prepared to face the consequences of their actions.

### THE CORAL HARPOON
According to legend, the **Harpoon of the Sea** was forged by the Once the [[God of the Forge]], the first god of the forge, who later succumbed to rage and madness. The intricate carvings on the spear depict violent and dangerous sea creatures, treacherous currents, and other symbols of the god of the ocean's destructive power. The jagged head of the harpoon is made of coral, representing the many facets of power flowing into one tip that symbolizes his violent power over the sea.

With this harpoon in hand, he is a force to be reckoned with, capable of calling forth massive waves, summoning creatures of the deep, and unleashing devastating storms. It is said that the harpoon is not only a weapon but also a tool, allowing him to shape the very fabric of the sea to his will. But such power comes at a cost, and those who wield the **Harpoon of the Sea** risk being consumed by their own violent nature.

### THE CROWN OF HAIFAN
The **Crown of the Ocean** is a symbol of the ocean god's more benevolent power. Carved from pearl and adorned with sparkling gems, the crown represents the treasures and wonders of the ocean. The intricate patterns on the crown depict schools of fish, majestic whales, and other symbols of the sea's beauty and abundance.

Wearing the **Crown of the ocean** grants the wearer great power over the ocean's resources, allowing them to call forth bountiful fish and other creatures from the deep. The crown also grants the wearer protection from the sea's dangers, shielding them from storms and other hazards. But the crown's power comes with a responsibility to protect and care for the sea and its creatures, and those who abuse its power risk invoking the wrath of the lord of the ocean himself.
