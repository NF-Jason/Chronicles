Once the when the [[World Tree]] brought forth the [[Goddess of Life]], reality needed a balance, and the Abyss brought forth death. Both opposites of the other neither god nor evil, just balance in the natural world.

Death is the keeper of the afterlife, the one who guides the souls of the departed to their final destination. When a mortal being dies, their soul is judged. If the soul is deemed unworthy, it undergoes a process of cleansing, where all memories and experiences are stripped away. This purified soul is then returned to the [[Sea of Souls]] to be reborn.

However, if the soul is deemed worthy, it is granted a place in a paradise of its own making, where it can reside for as long as it desires. When the soul is ready to be reborn, Death guides it back into the mortal world.

Death has no physical form, and is often depicted as a void or a mist. It is both feared and revered by the mortal races, as it holds the power to determine their ultimate fate.
