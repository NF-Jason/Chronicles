Cycle of the Year, by the Imperial Scholar Florianus

The length of a year in our world is determined by the great celestial body that circles our world disc, which serves as the foundation of our realm. This vast structure takes many months to traverse its way around the world disc, and marks the passage of time for all who dwell upon its surface. Our scholars estimate that it takes approximately 240 days for the celestial body to complete its circuit around the world disc, thereby defining a full cycle of the year.

In turn, each cycle of the year is divided into eight months, with each month determined by the orbit of a smaller celestial body that circles our world disc. This celestial orb takes but thirty of our days to complete its circuit around the world disc, marking the passage of time with its steady, predictable movements.

And yet, even as these great celestial orbs move across the skies, it is the motion of the great [[God of the Sun]] on his chariot that truly defines the passage of time in our world. The God circles above the crystal Dome that holds our world in place, pulling behind him a great burning orb that serves as our sun. With each complete circle around the Dome, the God marks the passage of a single day in our world, and the sun moves across the sky to bring light and warmth to all who dwell below.

It is said that the God circles the Dome thrice in a single hour, marking the passage of time with his endless journeys. And yet, despite the great distances he must traverse, his movements are so regular and predictable that we can measure time with remarkable accuracy. A single day in our world is equivalent to thirty of our hours, as we have observed over many years of careful study and observation.

Truly, the passage of time in our world is a wonder to behold, marked by the endless movements of celestial orbs and structures and the tireless journeys of the great God on his chariot. As a scholar, I am privileged to bear witness to these grand cycles of the year, and to study the mysteries of time and space that define our world.

# The Seasons
Early Spring: This is the season of rebirth and renewal, as the world awakens from its winter slumber. Plants begin to bud and bloom, and animals return from their winter migrations. The first signs of new life can be seen throughout the land, and the air is filled with the sweet scents of spring flowers.

Late Spring: As the days grow longer and warmer, the world explodes into a riot of colors and fragrances. This is the time of year when many plants are in full bloom, and the landscape is dotted with vibrant hues of pink, purple, and yellow. Animals are active and energetic, as they prepare for the long, warm months ahead.

Early Summer: As the world basks in the warmth of the sun, the days become longer and the nights shorter. This is the season of growth and vitality, as many plants and animals reach their peak. The air is filled with the hum of insects and the songs of birds, and the world is alive with activity.

Late Summer: As the sun beats down upon the world, the days grow hotter and drier. Many plants begin to wither and fade, and animals begin to slow down as they conserve their energy for the coming winter. The world is still alive with activity, but there is a sense of urgency in the air as all living things prepare for the changing of the seasons.

Early Autumn: As the world begins to cool and the days grow shorter, the landscape takes on a golden hue. This is the season of harvest and abundance, as many plants bear fruit and animals gather food for the winter months. The air is crisp and clear, and the world is filled with the colors and scents of autumn.

Late Autumn: As the leaves begin to fall and the air grows chillier, the world enters a period of transition and change. This is the time of year when many plants and animals go into hibernation or migrate to warmer climes. The landscape is blanketed in a riot of reds, oranges, and yellows, and the air is filled with the scents of woodsmoke and fallen leaves.

Early Winter: As the world is blanketed in snow and ice, the days grow shorter and the nights longer. This is the season of quiet and introspection, as many living things retreat into themselves to conserve energy and prepare for the coming spring. The air is still and hushed, and the world is filled with a serene beauty.

Late Winter: As the world prepares to emerge from its long slumber, the days begin to lengthen and the air grows milder. This is the time of year when the first signs of new life can be seen, as plants begin to stir and animals emerge from their winter hiding places. The world is still blanketed in snow and ice, but there is a sense of hope and renewal in the air.
